##Introduction

This sample shows how to connect your Windows 10 Universal app to Office 365 using the Microsoft Graph API (previously called Office 365 unified API) to send an email. It uses the Microsoft Graph SDK and Microsoft.Graph.OAuth2 helper library to handle user authentication and manipulation of the data returned by the Microsoft Graph. The sample uses the v2.0 authentication endpoint, which enables users to sign in with either their personal or work or school Microsoft accounts.

## Prerequisites ##

This sample requires the following:  

  * [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads) 
  * Windows 10 ([development mode enabled](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/dn706236.aspx))
  * Either a [Microsoft](www.outlook.com) or [Office 365 for business account](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office365/howto/setup-development-environment#bk_Office365Account).

##Register and configure the app

1. Sign into the [App Registration Portal](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/) using either your personal or work or school account.
2. Select **Add an app**.
3. Enter a name for the app, and select **Create application**.
	
	The registration page displays, listing the properties of your app.
 
4. Under **Platforms**, select **Add platform**.
5. Select **Mobile platform**.
6. Copy both the Client Id (App Id) and Redirect URI values to the clipboard. You'll need to enter these values into the sample app.

	The app id is a unique identifier for your app. The redirect URI is a unique URI provided by Windows 10 for each application to ensure that messages sent to that URI are only sent to that application. 

7. Select **Save**.

## Build and debug ##

**Note:** If you see any errors while installing packages during step 2, make sure the local path where you placed the solution is not too long/deep. Moving the solution closer to the root of your drive resolves this issue.

1. After you've loaded the solution in Visual Studio, configure the sample to use the client id and redirectURI that you registered by adding the corresponding values for these keys in the Application.Resources node of the App.xaml file.

2. Press F5 to build and debug. Run the solution and sign in with either your personal or work or school account.
